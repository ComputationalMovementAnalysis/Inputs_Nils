# What are the <span class="highlight"> most important </span> missing pieces?

--

Working with ...

1. ... Git from the commandline <span class = "highlight"> (to go beyond the basics) </span>
1. ... pulls and merges <span class = "highlight"> (collaboration!) </span>
<!-- 1. ... Git without RStudio\*  <span class = "highlight"> (to be independent)</span> -->
1. ... branches and forks <span class = "highlight"> (Git's *killer features*) </span>

# Git in the commandline (CLI)

- all clicks in the Git pane evoke *Git* Commands in the background

--

- the same commands can be called directly in the CLI

<!-- <span class = "highlight"> (and also switch back-and-forth between the GUI and the CLI) </span> -->
--

- e.g. `git push` pushes your changes to the repo

--

- Most Git tutorials assume you use Git in the CLI <span class = "highlight"> or at least know the appropriate commands</span>

--

- You should familiarize yourself with the most important Git terms

???

We will therefore cover the general git workflow including the terms

Especially important when you collaborate with others. Always "pull" before you "push"!
