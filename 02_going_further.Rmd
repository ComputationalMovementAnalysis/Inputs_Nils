# What are the <span class="highlight"> most important </span> missing pieces?

--

Working with ...

1. ... Git from the commandline <span class = "highlight"> (to go beyond the basics) </span>
1. ... pulls and merges <span class = "highlight"> (collaboration!) </span>
<!-- 1. ... Git without RStudio\*  <span class = "highlight"> (to be independent)</span> -->
1. ... branches and forks <span class = "highlight"> (Git's *killer features*) </span>

.footnote[<sup>1</sup> Commandline Interface]

--

- e.g. `git push` pushes your changes to the repo

--

- Most Git tutorials assume you use Git from the CLI

--

- You should familiarize yourself with the most important Git terms

???

We will therefore cover the general git workflow including the terms
