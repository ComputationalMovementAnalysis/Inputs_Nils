A typical project might look something like this.

- Which leads to this type of file naming
- However, this type of version control is linear and the changes depend on each other. 
- I.e. if you want to undo the changes in file "data_2010.05.25_huh??.dat", you will have to manually find the difference to the previouse file, and undo this in the newest version of the file.
- This can be somewhat solved by using a software that automates this for you (e.g. Dropbox, GoogleDrive)

.right-column[
Dropbox, Googledrive *et al.* are not designed for code since files are tracked: 

- individually
- continuously
- uncommented
]


---

.right-column[
With git however, tracking changes is

- <del>individually</del> individually *and* on a project basis
- <del>continuously</del> with "snapshots" (aka "commmits")
- <del>uncommented</del> with comments
]

???

- This allows easier time travel through dependent changes
- Which allows tinkering in a safe way ("camera off")
- you are required to add a comment to a commit, which makes changes easier to understand later on
