In this course you will submit some `R`-related materials: 

- two R-exercises (exercise 2 and 3)
- one semester project

A typical project might look something like this.

Information is captured via the filename
 <ul>
  <li>A unique identifier for each change</li>

this becomes extremely complicated: 
- with more files: Imagine two changes in two different files depend on each other
- with more people: Imagine collaborating with others

.right-column[
```{r, echo = FALSE, dpi = 300, fig.height=2, warning=FALSE}

What information is missing:
 <ul>
  <li>What changed?</li>
  <li>When was the change made?</li>
  <li>Who made the change?</li>
</ul> 

</div>


???

What is lacking:

- files must be manually compared
- is implicitly captured by the system, but is not reliable
- very important when collaborating

- sha1 hashes are guaranteed to be unique
- are usually abbreviated to the first 6 characters

- This can be somewhat solved by using a software that automates this for you (e.g. Dropbox, GoogleDrive)

<div class = "right-column">
What about Dropbox, Googledrive <em>et al.</em>?

.right-column[
These type of software are not designed for code since files are tracked: 

- individually
- continuously
- uncommented
]


---

<div class = "right-column">

</div>

.right-column[
With git however, tracking changes is

- <del>individually</del> individually *and* on a project basis
- <del>continuously</del> with "snapshots" (aka "commmits")
- <del>uncommented</del> with comments
]

???

- This allows easier time travel through dependent changes
- Which allows tinkering in a safe way ("camera off")
- you are required to add a comment to a commit, which makes changes easier to understand later on

  - `r fa("thumbs-up")` like repos
  - `r fa("binoculars")` follow developers 
  - `r fa("question-circle")` ask questions
  - `r fa("lightbulb")` make suggestions and

- Learning Git is quite challenging an can cause some initial pain

--

- You will need to develop a new workflow when coding (*committing* changes explicitly)

--

- You will need to learn new terminology (`stage`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`...)

--

- you will need to invest some time upfront:

--

  - Install the Git-software on your computer

--

  - Setup RStudio to work with Git

--

  - Create a Github account

# Today's Goals

---



1. Installing Git on your local computer <sup>1</sup>
2. Setting up RStudio to work with Git <sup>1</sup>
3. Initialize an RStudio project with Git-Version control (for exercise 1) 
4. Work on exercise 1 and commit changes to your local repository

.foonote[
<sup>1</sup> if you encounter technical issues or are simply overwhelmed by everything, you can alternatively work on the RStudio server, which has RStudio, R and Git already installed and correctly set up. 

Steps 1 - 3 are described in section [Exercise 1/Preperation](https://computationalmovementanalysis.github.io/W01_04_preperations.html), step 4 is described in [Exercise 1/ Tasks and inputs](https://computationalmovementanalysis.github.io/W01_05_tasks_and_inputs.html)
